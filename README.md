# Prediction Modelling as a Tool for Comorbidity Prevention and Harm Reduction
## Abstract
Comorbidity is a condition that effects up to 25% of the population. It means that someone has multiple co-morbid diagnoses that include: liver or kidney disease, diabetes, COPD, stroke, heart disease or failure, cancer, AIDS, and more. Comorbidity is often measured in clinical settings using a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI): A weighted index to predict risk of death within 1 year of hospitalization for patients with specific comorbid conditions. Comorbidity is often more than just a consequence of someone not taking care of their personal health or engaging in unhealthy habits. Comorbid conditions are often a product of the built environment and oneâ€™s social positioning, including but not limited to: housing quality/security, access to reliable transportation, labor conditions, access to nutritious foods, proximity to biohazardous environments, and exposure to climate change. Using NAIP imagery, Land Cover Index and Green Leaf Index were collected for each tract in Philadelphia and regressed onto the comorbidity rate. Land Cover Index, used as a heat proxy, showed statistically significant. And with a combination of other ACS variables, was used to develop a threshold that best predicts where an FQHC would be the best served to proactively manage comobridity as a public health risk. The neighborhood of choice resulted in Overbrook as the most at risk of worsening comorbidity, with heat and other environmental factors as highly predictive influences.
